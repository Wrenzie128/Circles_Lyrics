            <h1>  Circles <h4>by Post Malone </h4>  </h1>
            <p>We couldn't turn around <br>
                'Til we were upside down <br>
                I'll be the bad guy now <br>
                But, no, I ain't too proud <br> <br>
                I couldn't be there <br>
                Even when I tried <br>
                You don't believe it <br>
                We do this every time <br> <br>
                Seasons change and our love went cold <br>
                Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go <br>
                Run away, but we're running in circles <br>
                Run away, run away <br> <br>
                I dare you to do something <br>
                I'm waiting on you again <br>
                So I don't take the blame <br>
                Run away, but we're running in circles <br>
                Run away, run away, run away <br><br>
                Let go <br>
                I got a feeling that it's time to let go <br><br>
                I say so <br>
                I knew that this was doomed from the get-go <br><br>
                You thought that it was special, special <br>
                But it was just the sex though, the sex though <br>
                And I still hear the echoes (the echoes) <br>
                I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go <br>
                Seasons change and our love went cold <br>
                Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go <br>
                Run away, but we're running in circles <br>
                Run away, run away <br><br>
                I dare you to do something <br>
                I'm waiting on you again <br>
                So I don't take the blame <br>
                Run away, but we're running in circles <br>
                Run away, run away, run away <br><br>
                Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through <br>
                It's only me <br>
                What you got to lose? <br>
                Make up your mind, tell me <br>
                What are you gonna do? <br>
                It's only me <br>
                Let it go <br><br>
                Seasons change and our love went cold <br>
                Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go <br>
                Run away, but we're running in circles <br>
                Run away, run away <br><br>

                So I don't take the blame <br>
                Run away, but we're running in circles <br>
                Run away, run away, run away</p>
